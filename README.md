# Nextcloud with Docker compose

This repository contains a Docker compose file which can be used to easily create a Nextcloud instance.

- Fully-featured Nextcloud instance backed by a MySQL database
- Automatic SSL certificate issuance and renewal (using [`nginx-proxy-letsencrypt-companion`](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion))
- Automated encrypted backups to [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) using [`duplicacy-autobackup`](https://github.com/christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup). Can be customized to use any storage backend supported by duplicacy (S3, Hubic, etc.).

## Usage

Follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Create a Backblaze account and bucket

- Sign up for a Backblaze account at https://www.backblaze.com/b2/sign-up.html.

- Write down your Backblaze account ID and secret key (TODO) for later

- Create a B2 bucket (e.g. `christophetd-nextcloud-backups`) and write down its name for later

### Step 2: Point your subdomain to the appropriate machine

- If you don't have any, spin up a VPS on any cloud provider (AWS EC2, Digital Ocean, OVH...). If you use the following referral link, you'll benefit from $10 of free credit on Digital Ocean (and I will get $25): https://m.do.co/c/1504134cd374.

- Point your subdomain (e.g. `nextcloud.christophetd.fr`) to this newly created VPS

### Step 3: Configuration

Edit the `.env` file, and change at least the following:

- `HOST`: the hostname of your VPS (e.g. `nextcloud.christophetd.fr`)
- `B2_BUCKET`: the name of the B2 bucket you created in step 1
- `B2_ID` and `B2_KEY`: your B2 credentials from step 1
- `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: set it to a random passphrase. It will be used to encrypt your backups before shipping them to Backblaze.

### Step 4: Profit!

Run:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

You'll need to wait a few minutes on firts launch, as there is some certificate generation involved. Then, you should be able to access your Nextcloud instance!

You can now define your administrator credentials and use Nextcloud.
